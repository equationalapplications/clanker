- [x] Included error handling example
- [x] Included optimistic updates example
- [x] Included offline indicator example

## üß™ Phase 3: Testing

### Manual Testing - Online Mode

- [ ] Open app while online
- [ ] Navigate to character list - should load
- [ ] Create new character - should appear immediately
- [ ] Update character - should update immediately
- [ ] Delete character - should remove immediately
- [ ] Send chat message - should appear immediately
- [ ] Update profile - should update immediately

### Manual Testing - Offline Mode

- [ ] Populate cache while online (navigate through app)
- [ ] Enable airplane mode or disable WiFi
- [ ] View character list - should show cached characters
- [ ] View character detail - should show cached data
- [ ] View chat messages - should show cached messages
- [ ] Create character - should appear with pending indicator
- [ ] Update character - should update with pending indicator
- [ ] Delete character - should remove with pending indicator
- [ ] Send message - should appear with pending indicator

### Manual Testing - Reconnection

- [ ] With queued offline mutations, re-enable network
- [ ] Verify all queued mutations sync to server
- [ ] Verify pending indicators disappear
- [ ] Verify cache refreshes with server data
- [ ] Check that no data is lost
- [ ] Check that UI is consistent with server state

### Manual Testing - Error Handling

- [ ] Force an error (e.g., invalid data)
- [ ] Verify error message is shown
- [ ] Verify optimistic update is rolled back
- [ ] Verify retry button works
- [ ] Check that app doesn't crash

### Manual Testing - Real-time Sync

- [ ] Open app on two devices
- [ ] Create character on device 1
- [ ] Verify it appears on device 2 automatically
- [ ] Update character on device 2
- [ ] Verify it updates on device 1 automatically
- [ ] Send message on device 1
- [ ] Verify it appears on device 2 automatically

### Manual Testing - Performance

- [ ] Check initial load time (should be fast)
- [ ] Navigate between screens (should be instant with cache)
- [ ] Pull to refresh (should work smoothly)
- [ ] Create multiple characters (should handle bulk ops)
- [ ] Monitor network tab (should see reduced requests)

### Automated Testing (Future)

- [ ] Write unit tests for query key factories
- [ ] Write unit tests for optimistic update logic
- [ ] Write integration tests for cache invalidation
- [ ] Write E2E tests for offline scenarios
- [ ] Add CI/CD pipeline tests

## üìä Phase 4: Monitoring

### Development Monitoring

- [ ] Enable React Query DevTools (optional)
- [ ] Add console.log for cache operations
- [ ] Monitor network requests in DevTools
- [ ] Check cache hit rates
- [ ] Profile performance improvements

### Production Monitoring (Future)

- [ ] Add analytics for offline usage
- [ ] Track mutation queue sizes
- [ ] Monitor cache performance
- [ ] Track error rates
- [ ] Measure user engagement improvements

## üöÄ Phase 5: Optimization (Optional)

### Persistence Layer

- [ ] Install `@tanstack/react-query-persist-client`
- [ ] Install `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`
- [ ] Configure persister in `queryClient.ts`
- [ ] Test cache survives app restart
- [ ] Handle cache migration on schema changes

### Prefetching

- [ ] Identify common navigation patterns
- [ ] Add prefetching to list screens
- [ ] Prefetch detail data on hover/focus
- [ ] Optimize initial load sequence

### Infinite Queries

- [ ] Convert long lists to infinite queries
- [ ] Implement pagination for messages
- [ ] Add "Load More" UI
- [ ] Test scroll performance

### Background Sync

- [ ] Set up background task library
- [ ] Configure background sync intervals
- [ ] Test sync while app is backgrounded
- [ ] Handle background limitations (iOS/Android)

### Advanced Features

- [ ] Add LRU cache eviction for large datasets
- [ ] Implement query cancellation
- [ ] Add request deduplication
- [ ] Optimize bundle size (code splitting)

## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations

- [ ] Cache doesn't persist across app restarts (requires persistence layer)
- [ ] Large message histories may impact performance (need pagination)
- [ ] No conflict resolution for concurrent edits (last-write-wins)
- [ ] Background sync not implemented (mutations sync on app open only)

### Potential Issues to Watch

- [ ] Cache size growth over time
- [ ] Stale data edge cases
- [ ] Race conditions in optimistic updates
- [ ] Network request waterfalls
- [ ] Memory leaks from subscriptions

## üìù Final Review

### Code Quality

- [x] No TypeScript errors
- [x] No ESLint warnings
- [x] Consistent code style
- [x] Proper error handling
- [x] Console.logs cleaned up (except intentional ones)

### Documentation

- [x] Examples provided
- [x] Best practices documented

### Backward Compatibility

- [x] No breaking changes
- [x] Legacy hooks still work
- [x] Existing components work unchanged
- [x] Gradual migration possible

### User Experience

- [ ] App feels faster
- [ ] Offline mode works smoothly
- [ ] No jarring loading states
- [ ] Clear error messages
- [ ] Intuitive UI feedback

## üéØ Success Criteria

The offline support implementation is successful if:

1. **‚úÖ Zero Breaking Changes**: All existing code works without modifications
2. **‚úÖ Comprehensive Offline Support**: App works fully offline with cached data
3. **‚úÖ Optimistic Updates**: All mutations update UI immediately
4. **‚úÖ Automatic Sync**: Queued mutations sync when network returns
5. **‚úÖ Real-time Updates**: Changes from other devices appear automatically
6. **‚úÖ Better Performance**: Reduced network requests, faster navigation
7. **‚úÖ Clear Documentation**: Developers can understand and use new patterns
8. **‚úÖ Production Ready**: No critical bugs, stable in testing

## üéâ Completion

### When All Checkboxes Are Checked:

- Update main README.md with offline support section
- Announce to team
- Monitor for issues
- Gather feedback
- Plan next optimizations

### Rollout Plan:

1. Deploy to staging environment
2. Test with beta users
3. Monitor for 1 week
4. Deploy to production
5. Monitor production metrics
6. Iterate based on feedback
